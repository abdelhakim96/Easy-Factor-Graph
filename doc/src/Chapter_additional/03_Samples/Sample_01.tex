\section{Sample 01: Potential handling}

The aim of this series of examples is mainly to show how to handle the creation of variables and factors.

\subsection{part 01}

Part 01 creates a shape factor $\Phi_{AB}$, involving the pair of variables $A$ and $B$. Both that variables have a domain size equal to 4, i.e. $Dom(A) = \lbrace a_0 = 0, a_1 =1 , a_2=2, a_3=3 \rbrace$ and  $Dom(B) = \lbrace b_0=0, b_1=1, b_2=2, b_3=3 \rbrace$.
The generic value in the image $\Phi_{AB}$ is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \Phi_{AB}(A = a, B= b) = a + 2 \cdot b
\end{eqnarray} 

Table \ref{tab:S_1:t1} reports the entire image of $\Phi_{AB}$.

$a_2 = 2$ & 2     & 4     & 6     & 8     \\

$a_3 = 3$ & 3     & 5     & 7     & 9     \\

\end{figure}

Part 02 considers a ternary correlating factor $\Phi_{C\,\,V123}$, involving variables $V_1$, $V_2$ and $V_3$, each having a domain size equal to 3. Ternary factors cannot be part of a graph, but it is anyway possible to build them using class Potential$\_$Shape.
The values in the image of $\Phi_{C\,\,V123}$ are all 0, except for those combination for which $V_1,V_2$ and $V_3$ assume the same value ($0,1$ or $2$) and in such cases, the image is equal to 1.
\\
The same example builds at a second stage a ternary anti-correlating factor $\Phi_{A\,\,V123}$. The values in the image of $\Phi_{A\,\,V123}$  are all 1, except for those combination for which $V_1,V_2$ and $V_3$ assume the same value ($0,1$ or $2$) and in such cases the image is equal to 1.
\\
When considering a graph having only $\Psi_{C,\,V123}(\Phi_{C\,\,V123} \cdot w)$ as a factor, the ripartition function $Z$ is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
Z = (4^3 - 4) + 4 \cdot exp(w)
\end{eqnarray}
The probability to have as a realization a combination with the same values is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v ) &=& \sum _{i=0}^3 \mathbb{P}( V_1 = i,  V_2 = i, V_3 = i )  \\
&=& \sum _{i=0}^3 \frac{\Psi_{C\,\,V123}(i,i,i)}{ Z} \\
&=& 4 \cdot \frac{\Psi_{C\,\,V123}(0,0,0)}{ Z} \\
&=& \frac{4 \cdot exp(w)}{(4^3 - 4) + 4 \cdot exp(w) }
\end{eqnarray}
The value assumed by $\mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v | w)$  is reported in Figure \ref{fig:sample_01:0}, together with the complementary probability $1 - \mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v | w)$.
\\
When considering a graph having only $\Psi_{A,\,V123} = w exp( \Phi_{A\,\,V123} )$ as factor, the ripartition function $Z$ is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
Z = (4^3 - 4) \cdot exp(w) + 4
\end{eqnarray}
The probability to have as a realization a combination with the same values is equal to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v ) &=& \sum _{i=0}^3 \mathbb{P}( V_1 = i,  V_2 = i, V_3 = i )  \\
&=& \sum _{i=0}^3 \frac{\Psi_{A\,\,V123}(i,i,i)}{ Z} \\
&=& 4 \cdot \frac{\Psi_{A\,\,V123}(0,0,0)}{ Z} \\
&=& \frac{4}{(4^3 - 4) \cdot exp(w) + 4 }
\end{eqnarray}
The value assumed by $\mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v | w)$  is reported in Figure \ref{fig:sample_01:0}, together with its complement $1 - \mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v | w)$.
Indeed, when the variables are correlated, i.e. they share $\Psi_{C\,\,V123}$, the probability $\mathbb{P}( V_1 = v,  V_2 = v, V_3 = v | w)$ is big. Moreover, the more $w$ is high (i.e. the more the variables are correlated), the more the latter probability is big. On the opposite, when the variables are anti-correlated, the opposite situation arises.
